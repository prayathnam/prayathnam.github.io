	<h4>HISTORY OF TĀLA - Article by Sasirekha Raammohan</h4>
	<div>
		Music and Dance has been in society from time immemorial. It is as old as human civilization. Tāla is one of the ancient traditional rhythmic paterns of Indian music. Tāla is a metric cycle with a specific number of beats that recur in the same patern throughout a musical performance. It can be called the backbone of Indian music on which the structure of the song and dance is built. Tāla gives shape and form to the songs. It helps to control and stabilize the run of musical phrases. It is the mathemetics of music and dance. The subject of Tāla has been dealt in both Tamil and Sanskrit tradition and literature.

	<h4>Tala in Tamil Tradition</h4>
	<div>
		<p>
			‘Tāl’ means feet, beat or fundamental in Tamil. Since it is the fundamental for music and dance, it came to be known as Tālam. ‘Tāl’ means stablity (Nilainitral) in Tamil. The people joined in groups and danced together in moments of joy and ecstacy. When they jumped and danced, they heard the regular rhythmic sound of their feet Tāl, they named the sound of the feet as Tāla.The root of the word Tālam is ‘Tāl’ and ‘Am’ is a suffix.
		</p>
		<p>
			Vi.Pa.Ka.Sundaram also says that tapping of the feet came to be known as Tāla -‘Thālal adipathu tālam āyitru’ in his work ‘Pazhanthamizh Ilakkiyathil Isaiyial’.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ancient Tamil text Kūthanūl explains Tāla as ‘kāladi thatu’ i.e. tapping of the feet.
			In the medieval texts the two letters’Ta’ and ‘La’ have been regarded as indicative of ‘Siva’ and ‘Sakthi’ and ‘Tālam’ is the union of Siva and Sakthi.

	<h4>Different names for Tāla</h4>
	<div>
		<p>
			Thooku, Pāni etc in ancient Tamil literature..Tāla was known by different names like Sīr, Thūk ‘asaiyum sīrum isayōdu sethi vaguthanar unarthalum vallōr āre’ Tolkāpiyam; Seyyul; 10. The words were sung in music set to a particular Tāla. The people had separate Tāla and separate percussion instruments for different occasions and emotions.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Thookku ŉ sīru mendrivai māņivai arivai kāppa'.Pāniyum thūk  Kaliṭokai: kadavul vazthu. Kūthanūl written by Sathanar in 3rd century says that there was separate tāla for dance in king’s court and for dance for public.'Iyal oli podhuve seyal oli vethe'Kūthanūl: Tālanūl: 1252

	<h4>Different ways of counting Tāla</h4>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li class="padded"><strong>Matta Tāla and Sāippu Tāla:</strong> ‘Mattam means ‘equal sided’ in Tamil. This refers to the even numbers. Tālas of equal measure are called Matta Tāla. Eg: am = 1+1 =2. Varieties of tālas are formed by adding six and four and by dividing them.  Irandan matamil’.‘Mat means ‘inequal sides’in Tamil. This refers to the odd numbers. Tālas of inequal measure are called u  tāla.amil Tāla or Sāip.Mat.They can be a  combination of small and big whole numbers [1+2 = 3] or small and big fractions [1+1 ½ = 2 ½].</li>
			<li class="padded"><strong>Iyal Tāla and Aranga Tāla:</strong>
				<blockquote>
					<p>‘Iyarsei yulvari isaivari thānam puriyuda nulliyar puraviyal ainde’</p>
					<cite>Kūtanūl : Tālanūl : 802</cite>
				</blockquote>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="margin-bottom">Different types of tāla were used depending upon the subject matter in dance:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="padded">41 tālas for Puraḳūthu (for warfare)</li>
			<li class="padded">16 pānis for Agaḳūthu (for dance based on emotions)</li>
		</ul>
			 <cite>1/2 māthirayudaya Eka tālamudalāga 16 māthirayudaya pārvathilochana mīrāga sonna 41 tālamum purathirkkuriya Arumpadavurai on Cilapadikāram pg 9</cite>

	<h4>Tāla in Sanskrit Tradition</h4>
	<div>
		Natyasāstra is the first treatise in Sanskrit for ‘Natya’ which is said to be written in 3rd B.C. The subject of Tāla is dealt with in the thirty first chapter of Natyasāstra. Many scholars like Abinavagupta, Sarangadeva etc have writen commentaries on Natyasāstra during 11th and 12th century A.D. The word tāla is interpreted in several ways:
		<ol>
			<li class="padded">Instrument: A type of Ghana vadhya which is called tāla or kamsyatāla (bronze cymbals).</li>
			<li class="padded">Action in general: For instance striking with the hand.</li>
			<li class="padded">A specific action: One type os Saśabda kriya (audible sound).</li>
			<li class="padded">A specific timespan: A time span consisting of the repetition of a group of kriyas such as Cāccaputa etc</li>
			<li class="padded">The inner concept: Idea of supporting or unifying gita, vadhya, and Nrita by a series of kriyas</li>
			<li class="padded">A special type of measure in Nrita:
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						‘Vādhyam۬ tu yadghanam۬ proktam۬ kal۬۬۬)/.āpātālayānvitam (tah kālastasya pramānam hi vijńeyam tālayogatah.
					</p>
					<cite>Natyasāstra: 31: 1</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="margin-bottom">Here the interval of Tāla has tāla as a particular (special) measure</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						tālastalapratis thāyamiti dhātorghāni smrtah gitam vādyam tatha nrttam yatastale pratistham
					</p>
					<cite>Sangitaratnākara, 5,2</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<div>
					<p>
						When the verbal root ‘tala’ meaning base takes on the ‘ghan’ suffix, the word tāla is made. Gita, Vādya and Nrtta are based on it and hence it is called tāla. It is the principle which regulates, stabilizes and provides a basis to the different elements of Gita, Vādya and Nrtta is tāla.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tāla is said to have ten vital divisions called ‘prānās’. They are Kāla, Mārga, Kriya, Anga, Graha, Jathi, Kālai, Laya, Yathi and Prasthara. They are called as Tāladasaprānās. These are mentioned in Kūtanūl, Pancamarabu, and Nātyasāstra etc and it was re-defined by Venkatamakhi in Chathurdandi Prakasika in the fifteenth century.

	<h4>Influence of Socio Political Factors</h4>
	<ul>
		<li class="padded">The Bhakthi movement during 5A.D to 10 A.D gave rise to many compositions by Saivaite and Vaishnavaite saints. The compositions of Saivaite saints are termed as ‘Panniru Thirumurai’ and that of Vaishnavaite saints as Divyaprabandhams. The pann (raga) are given in the Thevārams but tālas are not specified. They are set in alai’.‘Kat format. There are seven tālas found in Divyaprabandham. They are Idayothu, kadayothu, Ezhothu, Onbadothu, Midandhothu, Muruginamidaindhothu, Mazhumadithal.</li>
		<li class="padded">During the Chola regime festivals in temples were celebrated in a grand scale. Some tālas were created for the pūja practices. Navasandhi Tālas are nine talas for use in nine junctions during the flag hoisting ritual preceding the annual festivals in temples for particular deity. A specific raga, tāla, music, dance, music instrument and sloka are rendered for each direction (Sandhi).</li>
		<li class="padded">Saint Arunagirinathar composed Thiruppugazh taking many ‘Candas’ into account and innovating some more.Since they bear no names, they came to be reckoned as ‘Canda Tālas’. The appropriate tālas of these songs are identified with the help of metric pattern called ‘Candakuzhippu’ preceding every song.</li>
		<li class="padded">After the Chera Chola regime, India was subject to lot of Muslim invasions. The socio political factors had an influence on the culture and so the ancient system of music and dance underwent many changes. The Indian music system was divided into Carnatic music system and Hindustani music system. Saptha tālas became predominant and the 108 tāla system went in vogue. Dhruvam, Matya, Rupaka, Jhampa, Triputa, Ata and Eka – these seven tālas are called Saptha Tālas. When the seven tālas – Dhruva, Matya, Rupaka, Jampha, Triputa, Ata, Eka combine with the five jāthis of laghu namely tisram, chathusram, misram, khandam, sankeernam it becomes 35 tālas.The 35 tālas with the gathi differentiations of Tisram, Chathusram, Misram, Khandam, Sankeernam, become 175 tālas in total.</li>
		<li class="padded">In Hindustāni music it was considered that the mode of counting the aksarās of the angās is immaterial provided the beats occurred at the proper placements. This type of Kālakriya gained entry into south Indian music system during the eighteenth century. That is why it was named ‘Desiya Ādi ‘which later got changed to Desādi. Thus we have Desādi and yādi.Mad tālas in South Indian Music.</li>
		<li class="padded">Some of the commonly used tālas apu talas.  For example- The Druta and Laghu of Caturasra jāti Rupaka tāla is changed to Anudruta and Druta in medium and fast tempo..apu talas. Caturasra Jāti Triputa Tāla has been named Ādi tāla in short but the kriya or action are the same, whereas the Kriya undergoes change in Rupaka and C.in the twentieth century are Ādi, Rupaka and C
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Findings</h4>
	<div>
		There have been periodical changes in the music in correspondence with the political and social changes. Hence there have been additions, omissions and changes in the form, action, and usage of tāla. There have been different terminologies for the same or different names for the same. Some of the notable changes are given below:
		<ul>
			<li class="padded">The Mārga tālas mentioned by Barata later become part of Desi tālas and vice-versa.</li>
			<li class="padded">a Tāla or Aranga Tāla in Kūthanūl (Tamil)..ācaputa are called Marga Tālas in Natyasāstra (Sanskrit) but is a part of Āt.acaputa and C.For example C</li>
			<li class="padded">The component ‘Guru’ was taken as the base in tāla structure in Nātyasāstra but later ‘Laghu’ becomes the fundamental factor.</li>
			<li class="padded">The terminology of aksara and mātra get interchanged after the 12th century.The measure for Mātra is
				<ul>
					<li class="padded">1 nimesa in Panchamarbu</li>
					<li class="padded">5 short syllable in Natyasāstra</li>
					<li class="padded">3 counts in Arumapadaurai’s commentary on Cilapadikāram</li>
					<li class="padded">3 counts in Arumapadaurai’s commentary on Cilapadikāram</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li class="padded">Yati was dependant on Gita and Vādya during Bharatha’s period. In present day yati applies to the end portion of the song or tirmanam only.</li>
			<li class="padded">The variation in Kālapramānam or the tempo was during the rendition of the song but now it is wrong to do so</li>
			<li class="padded">Different tālas were employed for prose, poetry and dance. Currently all the three follow a unique system – ‘Saptha tāla system</li>
