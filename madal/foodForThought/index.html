	<h4>HISTORY OF TĀLA - Article by Sasirekha Raammohan</h4>
	<div>Music and Dance has been in society from time immemorial. It is as old as human civilization. Tāla is one of the ancient traditional rhythmic paterns of Indian music. Tāla is a metric cycle with a specific number of beats that recur in the same patern throughout a musical performance. It can be called the backbone of Indian music on which the structure of the song and dance is built. Tāla gives shape and form to the songs. It helps to control and stabilize the run of musical phrases. It is the mathemetics of music and dance. The subject of Tāla has been dealt in both Tamil and Sanskrit tradition and literature.</div>
	<h4>Tala in Tamil Tradition</h4>
	<div>
		<p>
			‘Tāl’ means feet, beat or fundamental in Tamil. Since it is the fundamental for music and dance, it came to be known as Tālam. ‘Tāl’ means stablity (Nilainitral) in Tamil. The people joined in groups and danced together in moments of joy and ecstacy. When they jumped and danced, they heard the regular rhythmic sound of their feet Tāl, they named the sound of the feet as Tāla.The root of the word Tālam is ‘Tāl’ and ‘Am’ is a suffix.

			Vi.Pa.Ka.Sundaram also says that tapping of the feet came to be known as Tāla -‘Thālal adipathu tālam āyitru’ in his work ‘Pazhanthamizh Ilakkiyathil Isaiyial’.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ancient Tamil text Kūthanūl explains Tāla as ‘kāladi thatu’ i.e. tapping of the feet.
			In the medieval texts the two letters’Ta’ and ‘La’ have been regarded as indicative of ‘Siva’ and ‘Sakthi’ and ‘Tālam’ is the union of Siva and Sakthi.
