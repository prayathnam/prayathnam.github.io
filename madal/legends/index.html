	<div>
		<p>I believe that dance communicates man’s deepest, highest and most spiritual thoughts and emotions far better than words, spoken or written.</p>
 		
 		<p>“What are you reading Ma? Who said this? About dance?......Huh?”</p>
		
		<p>“Wait, wait.....one at a time, replied Amma, you need to start at the very beginning and take it one at a time!”</p>
		
		<p>“Ok, so who are you quoting?”</p>
		
		<p>“Well, it is Ted Shawn, one of the greatest pioneers who changed the face of dance particularly Indian dance.”</p>
		
		<p>“Ted Shawn? Is he Indian? .....North Indian? South Indian?” asked Shankar excitedly!</p>

		<p>“No he was not. He was an American Shankar. He was born in Kansas city on 21st October 1891!”</p>

		<p>“So it is more than 100 years now.....Ayyo! Ancient times!”</p>

		<p>“But golden times Shankar!”, interjected Amma. “Did you know that his original name was Edwin Myers but his nickname Ted was what stuck on for the rest of his life?”</p>

		<p>“Oh! ...American! So He would have been rich and well educated and anyway it is so so so easy to do anything in America, right?”</p>

		<p>“Who said so? Ted was born in a conservative family and just because he was American nothing came easy. He worked very very hard! So unlike you!”</p>

		<p>“Ok! Ok! But a man, ...and doing dance! So sissy! Whatever made him turn to that?”</p>

		<p>“Well.....can you listen patiently? Ted was paralyzed from hip down after an overdose of a serum meant to cure an attack of diphtheria. He turned to dance in order to reactivate his limbs that were paralyzed. He started with simple ballroom steps and the process of dance itself was much more than the cure. He realized the power of dancing from the soul, just in the same manner as miracles happen when a prayer is uttered from the heart.”</p>

		<p>“.....so--Amma? This boy?.....could he move and dance finally?</p>

		<p>“Yes! Much more than that! He made the onlookers of the dance realize that there was dignity to a man who danced!”</p>

		<p>“But Amma! ...people will say ‘sissy’ when a guy dances.”</p>

		<p>“Its not the dance itself but how you dance it, Shankar. Anyway, hear me out! Ted proved this by selecting a few men and he trained them in imaginative movement glorifying the male form. With this band of students he toured erasing all the long held beliefs against males dancing in public. Did you know that he had the first and only all-male dance company in America?”</p>

		<p>“Really? In those times? Great!”</p>

		<p>“Yes great indeed! And he took it a step further. He even managed to make dance a subject in universities all across the country.”</p>
		 
		<p>“.....But all this was in America. What about Indian dancing? You can’t do the same here.....?”</p>

		<p>“Wait! Wait! To continue the story and to give you the answer I need to tell you about a lady who changed some things in his life. This lady was Ruth St.Denis. She was already performing and touring with her own repertoire but she had a preference for everything with an Indian slant. Some of her pieces had Indian names like ‘Radha’, ‘The Yogi’ and ‘The dance of the black and gold sari’.</p>

		<p>“Ted Shawn respected her sense of theatre and they married the same year.”</p>

		<p>“And they lived happily ever after”, added Shankar.</p>

		<p>“Well ! Sit still and listen! The story is not over. They started their school and named it Denishawn; and their company dancers were called Denishawn dancers. They took and trained many aspiring dancers and the company toured to many many parts of the world. They toured the orient in 1925. The tour lasted 25 months and covered countries like Malaya, Japan, China, Java ,Cambodia and Ceylon. It was their practice to seek out local dancers and dance teachers and whenever possible they took lessons as well.”</p>

		<p>“They soon reached India and they had heard of Nautch dancing as the British referred to dancing in India. In fact they got an opportunity to meet two star performers Bachwa Jan and Malka Jan, both Kathak dancers. Ruth was so taken in by their dancing that she got up to improvise to their music. Bachwa Jan was overjoyed and gifted Ruth her anklets.”</p>

		<p>“They even toured South India, visiting Madurai and witnessed the dance of the celebrated Devadasi, Kamalambal. The Nizam of Hyderabad hosted them for 5 days at the end of which they were presented a book of poems written in Urdu by the Nizam himself! The Indian visit made them compose more and more dances with Indian ideas and themes like ‘The Hindu Warrior’ and one on Lord Krishna. Um....Shall I stop Shankar? Maybe.....I can skip the Siva dance?”</p>

		<p>“Ma! Ma!  Please just when it is so interesting!”</p>

		<p>“Alright! Shawn was inspired by the Nataraja bronzes of Siva that he created a dance based on the Hindu technique. He sought the help of a friend to actually carve the ring of fire and platform for him to stand on! A befitting score was composed and this dance was a huge success and was called ‘Cosmic Dance of Siva’.”</p>

		<p>“How was that possible without learning Bharatanatyam?” asked Shankar, perplexed.</p>

		<p>“Though he did not train in Bharatanatyam both St.Denis and Shawn made use of every opportunity to learn dances from the Santhals, Tibetans and even Pandit Hira Lal, the Kathak dancer who taught them ‘Mohr Nautch’ or Peacock dance.”</p>

		<p>“But dancing Siva’s Dance --How was that possible?”</p>

		<p>“True, Shankar. In Shawn’s own words, ‘I never gave a performance without consciously asking Siva to take possession of my body’.</p>

		<p>It was the essence and the spirit of the dance that he imbibed and translated in a manner of his own -- now do you understand? And by the way, the Lord of dance is Nataraja. Is he sissy?”</p>

		<p>“No! Not at all!”, said Shankar, in feverish excitement.</p>

		<p>“He is God isn’t he? But its true! There is so much power and strength even in the way the image looks!”, exclaimed Shankar.</p>

		<p>“Ok, what about dancers like Pandit Durga Lal and Guru Gopinath? Were they sissy? See?”, said Amma happy that her boy was finally seeing some sense.</p>

		<p>“Anyway, returning to the story, Ted Shawn founded a centre that he called the University of the Dance and launched the Jacob’s Pillow festival!</p>

		<p>“You mean the Jacob’s Pillow Festival?”</p>

		<p>“Yes, and over the years many American dancers took classes. Some of them were Nala Najan and Matteo. Among those who performed or gave lectures were Balasaraswathi, Rukmini Devi and Ramgopal. Ted Shawn was acknowledged as the Father of Modern American Dance.”</p>

		<p>“So, you mean this great man invited even the greats like Balasaraswathi and Rukmini Devi and recognized their worth even beyond the shores of their own motherland?”</p>

		<p>“Yes ....and the Indian roots never deserted him, for he chose to be known as ‘Papaji”</p>

		<p>“Isn’t that truly an Indian way of addressing someone?” asked Shankar. “So did he become famous and rich?”</p>

		<p>“He was rich in heart but when he passed away on 9th january 1972, he died a heart-broken man; sad, that despite all his contribution to dance he received no financial support from anyone to realize much of his dreams.”</p>

		<p>“Amma! I think his dreams still live and maybe, maybe one day they will be realized through many young minds especially men and even boys! Maybe even by me!”</p>

		<p>Amma smiled to herself! “Ted Shawn was right!”</p>

		<p>He said, ‘I believe that DANCE is a way of life, which will lead humanity into continually higher and greater dimensions of existence.’</p>
