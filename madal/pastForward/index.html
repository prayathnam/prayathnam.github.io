	<h4>Origins</h4>
 	<div>
 		<p>
 			The Pallava-s ruled the southern portion of Andhra Pradesh and northern portion of Tamil Nadu upto Tiruchirapalli from the 5th to 9th century AD with their capital as Kanchipuram. The lineage of the Pallava-s is not clear but it is believed that they came from a north indian dynasty. They inherited lands in the south through marriage to Andhra princesses and moved and adopted the ways of the locals and named themselves after the inherited land of Tondai (meaning creeper) The word Pallava also means creeper.

			The period preceding the Pallava rule (2nd to 5th century AD) was known as the ‘dark age’ ruled by the Kalebras who were supposedly jain and buddhist rulers. They discouraged fine arts and we do not have any inscriptions or sculptures of evidence of dance and music till Pallava rule.

			Music and dance became tools for worship in temples which were built according to Agama rules for puja and construction of the temple. Dance and music were part of the nithya puja-s and worship in the temple . To carry out these duties, devadasi-s (servants of God) women deidicated to the temple were appointed in each temple. Simultaneously the courts had dancing women for purpose of entertainment.

Thanks to the rulers of the time who were well versed in the fine arts, dance and music flourished in the temples and provided a centre for artistes to thrive. Some of the greatest tamil bhakti poetry like tevarams as produce in this era. We owe the early beautiful temples of intricate carvings and heritage preservation to the rulers of the pallava period.
