				Every dance school has its unique method of teaching and practice. Keeping this in mind we have attempted to unite existing practices and bring out a six stage progression that is relevant and most mandatory to any student learning the art of Bharatanātyam. We have attempted to include the study of other classical and folk traditions with the importance to the learning of stories from the puranas that is so much a part of our practical training.

				Yathnam Level - 6 exams will be judged by veterans in the field and on completion the student is certified as “ Bharatha Kala Mani” and is given an opportunity to perform a solo dance recital under the aupices of a renowned sabha in Chennai.
